# Arrays and Pointers in C

This directory contains practice programs illustrating the use of arrays and pointers in C. Each program addresses a specific problem, with the code serving as the solution to the corresponding question.

## Topics Covered
- Function pointers
- Finding the largest element in an array
- Summing elements of two arrays
- Element-wise addition of two arrays

## Practice Questions

### 1. Function Pointer Program
Write a program to perform multiple operations (addition, multiplication, and subtraction) on two integers using function pointers. Store the functions in an array of pointers and use a loop to call each function. Test your program with integers `7` and `5`. If your output matches the output of the solution program, then you should try testing your program with user input.  
**Solution:** [function_pointers.c](function_pointers.c)

### 2. Largest Number in an Array
Write a program that prompts the user to enter 10 integers into an array. Create a function to find and return the largest number in the array. Use the function in your program and display the largest number.
**Solution:** [largest_number.c](largest_number.c)

### 3. Sum of Two Arrays
Write a program that computes the sum of elements in two arrays. Create a function that takes two arrays as input, calculates their sums, and returns the total. Test the program with arrays `{1, 2, 3}` and `{4, 5, 6}`. If your output matches the output of the solution program, then you should try changing the sizes of the arrays and ask for user input instead. Also try doing the same with multi-dimensional arrays. 
**Solution:** [sum_of_two_arrays.c](sum_of_two_arrays.c)

### 4. Element-wise Addition of Two Arrays
Write a program to perform element-wise addition of two arrays. Create a function that takes two arrays and their size as input, calculates their element-wise sum, and stores the result in a third array. Print the resultant array. Use arrays `{1, 2, 3}` and `{4, 5, 6}` for testing. If your output matches the output of the solution program, then you should try changing the sizes of the arrays and ask for user input instead. Also try doing the same with multi-dimensional arrays.
**Solution:** [element_wise_addition_of_arrays.c](element_wise_addition_of_arrays.c)

Remember that there isn't one best way of solving coding problems, so don't put yourself in a box by trying to do exactly what you'll see in the solution programs. Add your own niche to your problem solving approach and let it grow into something that the world will remember you for. Happy Coding!
